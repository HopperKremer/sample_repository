5. accept a number and check for palindrome


6.Find the sum of all elements of a given array?
var arr = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20];

7)Find Duplicate Characters in a String 

8)Find first non-repeated character in a String 

9)Reverse a String(trying using without reverse method in String Builder) 

10)Compute floor of a division and modules.Apply Overloading for four different primitive datatypes 

11)Check if a string contains substring(String and substring are input) 

12)Extract Min and Max of two numbers(int,long,float and double) 

13)Write a Programm to sort an Array using loop(Not using Arrays or Collections classes) 

14)Write a Programm to reverse a Array(using Loops) 

15)Create a interface Arithmetic which contains a method signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface. 

  divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12 

  Input : 6   

  Output: I implemented: Arithmetic  

            12
